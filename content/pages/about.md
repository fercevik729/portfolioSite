Hi my name is Furkan Ercevik, and I am a 2nd year Computer Science B.S. student at UCSC. I am currently taking CSE 101 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CSE 120 (Computer Architecture). 

I am experienced in Golang, Python, C/C++, JAVA, Docker, CI/CD, HTML/CSS, gRPC, REST, AWS EC2, ECR, and CloudFormation. I have also worked with the Gorilla Mux and GORM frameworks in Golang, and Flask and Pycord in Python.

I have developed several personal projects that are listed here as well as some Discord bots with my friends. For more information please check out my [github](https://github.com/fercevik729)!

Currently I am interested in programming microservices and deploying them to cloud services as well as developing new Machine Learning applications using TensorFlow in Python.
