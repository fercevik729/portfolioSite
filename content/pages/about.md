Hi, my name is Furkan Ercevik, and I am a Computer Science B.S. student at UCSC. I am currently taking CSE 115A (Introduction to Software Engineering), CSE 140 (Artificial Intelligence), and CSE 180 (Database Systems I). 

I am experienced in Golang, Rust, Python, C/C++, Haskell, JAVA, Docker, CI/CD, gRPC, REST, AWS Ecosystem, Agile Methodologies, and more. I am currently using the tokio and pnet crates in my Rust project **nazar**. In the past, I've utilized the Gorilla Mux and GORM frameworks in Golang and Flask, FastAPI, & Pycord in Python. I have also dabbled in frontend development using bleeding-edge frameworks like SvelteKit and more established frameworks like Vue and React. I am also learning Java and the Spring framework to effectively build microservices at scale.

I have developed several personal projects that are listed here as well as some Discord bots. For more information please check out my **[github](https://github.com/fercevik729)!**

Currently I am interested in programming secure microservices and deploying them to cloud services as well as developing new Machine Learning applications in Python.

In my free time I enjoy bodybuilding, playing soccer, and learning about the latest technologies.
