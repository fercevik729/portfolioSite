<h2 id="about">About<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#about">#</a></h2>
<p>This project is mostly made in Golang using the Gorilla Mux and GORM frameworks. It also implements several other features that are common in many webservices today.

<h2 id="structure">Structure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#structure">#</a></h2>
<p>The application consists of 4 separate services that were eventually all linked as Docker containers with <code>docker compose</code>.</p>
<h3 id="grpc">gRPC<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#grpc">#</a></h3>
<p>The gRPC service was developed using protocol buffers and Golang. It supports bidirectional streaming as well as typical unary services. However, bidirectional streaming is difficult if not impossible to implement with current frameworks for REST. So in order to access the streaming service the user must utilize <code>grpcurl</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  grpcurl --plaintext -msg-template -d @ localhost:9090 Watcher/SubscribeTicker
</code></pre><p>This will open a &ldquo;streaming session&rdquo; from which users will send requests of the following format and receive updated financial information.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  {&#34;Ticker&#34;: &#34;MSFT&#34;, &#34;Destination&#34;: &#34;EUR&#34;}
</code></pre><p>Users can also directly request the unary service:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>grpcurl --plaintext -msg-template -d &#39;{&#34;Ticker&#34;: &#34;MSFT&#34;, &#34;Destination&#34;:&#34;USD&#34;}&#39; localhost:9090 Watcher/GetInfo
