      <description>STLKER STLKER is a stock tracking application that utilizes RESTful and gRPC microservices to serve content neatly in the command line via curl and grpcurl
About This project is mostly made in Golang using the Gorilla Mux and GORM frameworks. It also implements several other features that are common in many webservices today. Moreover, this project was completed in order to develop a more complete understanding of microservice architecture, as well as to create something that can be used directly from the command line without much parsing.</description>
